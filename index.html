                <p class= "top_para_margin-top"> 
                     Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I’m an ambitious and curious Junior UX/UI Designer who never gives up and loves helping 
                     people achieve their goals with user-center design. My ever-expanding toolbox to help connect and understand people includes my UX/UI 
                     certification of professional education at Georgia Institute of Technology along with 10 years in event design which showcased skills 
                     including problem solving, logical reasoning and empathizing with users.
               </p>

                <p class= "para_margin-top">
                     I discovered my UX/UI calling when I was helping my entrepreneur fiancé with his side gigs and was conducting usability testing and task 
                     analysis, and he asked if I had ever heard of user experience or user interface. It was then that I dove right in and discovered my love 
                     for user research and design. 
                </p>

                <p class= "para_margin-top">
                     One of the things I love about life, is that you never know where it will take you. 
                </p>

                <p class= "para_margin-top">
                     A little bit about me personally is that I’m always trying to grow and learn something new, as my favorite question is “why?”. 
                     Outside of work I love fishing, campaign, hiking, traveling or dancing. Pretty much anything that is active and gets me out to 
                     enjoy life with others.
                </p>

                <p class= "para_margin-top para_margin-bottom">
                    I am currently looking for new opportunities, so please don't hesitate to reach out— I'm happy to chat about work or play!
                </p>
